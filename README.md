## Code Structure

The application is organized as follows:

- **`src/components/`**: Contains the main components such as `ContainerSearchApp`, `ContainerWeatherApp`, `ContainerNowTime`, etc.
- **`src/styles/`**: Includes all CSS modules for styling components.
- **`src/utils/`**: Contains utility functions for handling data processing.

## API Usage

The app uses the following APIs:

- **[Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api)**: Fetches prayer times based on the selected city.
